// Kiwi's Tech Tree Overhaul (General Upgrade Configurations)
// Version 2.0
// Created: 31 October 2020 for KSP 1.9.1 to 1.10.1
// Last Updated: 25 April 2022 for KSP 1.12.3
// 19 November 2020: Added general settings for Kerbalism and Engine Ignitor
// 22 November 2020: Added Science Difficulty Setting
// 23 November 2020: Added upgrade toggle switches
// 28 November 2020: Added cost multipliers for various parts (not yet implemented in-game)
// 17 January 2021: MOAR Options
// 19 July 2021: Updated cost and entrycost multiplier options.
// 25 April 2022: Revamped Options

// IMPORTANT NOTE: These settings are not foolproof.  Incorrect settings can break your game!!!!  Change only after you have backed up your save!
// If using a patch either do not specify a pass or use the :FIRST pass to ensure that your patch runs before any Kiwi Tech Tree patches reference them.

		KERBALENGINEER = off	// Options: on/off Turning on will add Kerbal Engineer modules to all probes.
		RCS = on				// Options: on/off Turning off will disable the RCS upgrades in KTT. This is only relevant if Rational Resources is installed, otherwise it is disabled.
		REACTION = on			// Options: on/off Turning off will disable the Reaction Control upgrades in KTT. Disabled if certain Reaction Control mods are present like Mandatory RCS or SemiSaturated Reaction Wheels.
		SAS = on				// Options: on/off Turning off will disable the Probe SAS upgrades in KTT.  Note that this result in the default SAS level for all probes and they may be out of order in the tech tree.  I will not balance accordingly.
		SOLAR = on		 		// Options: on/off Turning off will disable the solar panel upgrade system upgrades in KTT. Only relevant if Near Future Solar is installed, otherwise it is disabled.

		// adaptive will take # of Science Mods x Tech Tier x Multiplier and add that to the default tree cost.  Thus if you have 5 science mods with a multiplier of 1, the Tier 4 costs will be 80 + 5 x 4 x 1 = 100
