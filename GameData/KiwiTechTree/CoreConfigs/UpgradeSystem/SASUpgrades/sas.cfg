// Kiwi's Tech Tree Overhaul (Probe Part Upgrades)
// Version 2.0
// Created: 10 September 2020 for KSP 1.9.1
// Last Updated: 29 April 2022 for KSP 1.12.3
// 10 September 2020:
// 1 October 2020: Adds support for Smart Docking Aid to all probes if SmartDockingAid installed.  Not currently possible to toggle it only when probes reach SAS Level 3
// 8 October 2020: Added in functionality to disable the SAS module until the first upgrade!
// 18 October 2020: Changed positioning of flight control unlocks
// 26 October 2020: Changed KiwiAerospace to KiwiTechTree
// 12 December 2020: Added clarifying text where upgrades for probes are located.
// 29 April 2022: Added upgrade for non-probes

// Thanks to hint by KerbMav to add the moduleIsEnabled!
// Strip out SAS functionality of all probes except for stability control and add back in via upgrades
